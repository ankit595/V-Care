    "question": "What's the procedure for performing CPR?",
    "answer": "The procedure for performing CPR involves several steps. First, ensure the scene is safe, and then check for responsiveness by tapping the person's shoulder and asking if they're okay. If they don't respond, call emergency services. Next, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open the airway. Check for breathing by looking, listening, and feeling for breaths. If the person is not breathing, begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the center of their chest and interlocking your fingers. Perform chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, allowing the chest to fully recoil between compressions. After 30 compressions, give two rescue breaths by pinching the person's nose, making a seal over their mouth with your mouth, and blowing until you see their chest rise. Continue cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths until help arrives or the person starts breathing."
